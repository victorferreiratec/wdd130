<!--The "target" attribute allows you to specify that a link should 
open in a new tab by using the "_blank" value. 
Normally this decision should be left up to the user, who can choose to open a link in a new tab,
new window, or private/incognito window within their browser.

for example:

<a href="https://www.byui.edu/about/" target="_blank">About | BYU-Idaho</a>
-->
