            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p><strong>Splash Withe Water Rafting</strong>

                Founded on March 15, 2010, Splash Rafting was born from the dream of a group of friends passionate about extreme sports and nature. Marcos, Renata, and Carlos wanted to create a company that offered thrilling rafting experiences while inspiring people to overcome their own limits.
                
                The name "Splash" symbolizes the impact of water and the journey of self-discovery and courage. The first expedition took place on the Paraíba do Sul River, and Splash Rafting quickly became known for combining adventure with environmental awareness and personal growth.
                
                Over the years, the company grew, but its purpose remained the same: to offer challenges that connect people to nature and themselves, teaching that true victory lies in overcoming one's own fears and limitations.</p>
